	<h1>Early Life</h1>
	<p>-Although little about me is known, I started my life in Columbus Ohio on December 18, 1989.

	<br><br>-Growning up in North DFW's upcoming surbian complex in the early 90s I found myself building forts and playing sports.
	<br><br>-From childhood activities came driving at 16 and working my first job (Haagan Dazs), to graduation from Flower Mound High School in 2008.</p>
	<br><br>-Upon graduation I worked and traveled for a brief time - enjoying freedom and the world.</p>

	<h2>College</h2>
	<p>-First day of classes was xxxxxx. First semester of college made the deans list.
	<br><br>-Originally I was a business major with a focus on business management. However, after a trip to PA where I talked to my uncle a data miner I decided to come back to Texas State University and take a computer science class.
